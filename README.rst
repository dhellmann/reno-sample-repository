========================
 Reno Sample Repository
========================

This repository holds sample release notes used for my EuroPython 2018
presentation.

To use this repository with reno, you can either install tox and then
run "tox -e docs" to see the HTML output, or install reno by itself
and use commands like "reno report".

The documentation for reno is available online at
https://docs.openstack.org/reno/latest/
